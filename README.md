# üöÄ Differential Drive Robot Simulation Project ü§ñ

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive simulation of a differential drive robot using ROS, Gazebo, and OpenCV. It integrates various elements like robotic state publishers, image processing, and sensor data handling to create a realistic simulation environment.

## Features
- üåå Launches a Gazebo simulation environment with a custom differential drive robot.
- üì∑ Integrates OpenCV for image processing and edge detection.
- ü§ñ Includes URDF files for robot modeling.
- üïπÔ∏è Provides rviz configuration for visualization.

## Launch File Arguments
- `paused`: Start simulation in a paused state.
- `use_sim_time`: Use simulation time.
- `gui`: Launch with or without Gazebo GUI.
- `headless`: Run in a headless mode.
- `debug`: Enable debug mode.

## Image Converter Node
- Subscribes to raw image feed from the camera.
- Performs edge detection using OpenCV.
- Publishes processed image data.

## Robot Description
- The robot, `vehiclediffdrive`, is defined with various components like wheels, camera, and laser.
- Uses different materials for visual distinction in Gazebo.
- Configured with joints and plugins for movement and sensor data processing.

## Panels and Preferences in RViz
- Customizable RViz panels for different displays and tools.
- Pre-configured settings for Grid, RobotModel, Image, and LaserScan displays.
